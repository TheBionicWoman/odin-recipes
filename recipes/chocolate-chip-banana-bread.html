    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Banana bread can be eaten any time of the day (or at least to me it can).
            This banana bread recipe includes chocolate chips, making this banana bread 
            all the more sweeter.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups ripe and mashed banana (3-4 medium bananas), measured</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup 2% Greek yogurt (sour cream also works)</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup mini chocolate chips + a handful more for sprinkling on top</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 325F and grease and line a 9x5 loaf pan with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the melted butter and sugars until you reach a paste-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Add in your mashed bananas followed by the eggs, yogurt, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Once all of your wet ingredients are mixed together, fold in the dry ingredients. Then, fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and spread it even. Sprinkle extra chocolate chips on top if you like.</li>
            <li>Bake for 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes or until a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs.</li>
            <li>Let it cool completely before removing from the pan. Store at room temperature in an air-tight container.</li>
        </ol>
